     1.1 Core Definitions
    </div>
    <div class="card-body">
     <ul>
      <li>
       <strong>
        Zero Trust
       </strong>
       – A security model that assumes no implicit trust based on
                        network location, device, or identity. Every access request is explicitly authenticated,
                        authorized, and continuously evaluated, regardless of where it originates.
      </li>
      <li>
       <strong>
        Never trust, always verify
       </strong>
       – Core principle of Zero Trust:
       <em>
        trust is not a starting state, it’s a temporary outcome of verification
       </em>
       .
      </li>
      <li>
       <strong>
        Micro-segmentation
       </strong>
       – Fine-grained isolation of workloads, services, or
                        data using logical segments (network, identity, app-level policies) so that compromise
                        of one segment has minimal blast radius.
      </li>
      <li>
       <strong>
        Continuous verification
       </strong>
       – Ongoing validation of identity, device state,
                        context (location, risk signals), and behavior during a session, not just at login time.
      </li>
      <li>
       <strong>
        Control plane
       </strong>
       – Components that define and distribute policy
                        (e.g., identity provider, policy engine, configuration management, IaC).
      </li>
      <li>
       <strong>
        Data plane
       </strong>
       – Components that actually handle traffic and enforce policy
                        (proxies, API gateways, sidecars, service meshes, WAFs, host firewalls).
      </li>
      <li>
       <strong>
        Trust boundary
       </strong>
       – A point where data or control crosses between actors
                        with different trust levels or responsibilities (user ↔ service, service ↔ DB,
                        tenant A ↔ tenant B, on-prem ↔ cloud).
      </li>
      <li>
       <strong>
        Identity-aware access
       </strong>
       – Access decisions are based primarily on strong
                        identity signals (user, service account, workload identity), not IP addresses alone.

     1.2 How These Components Relate in a Real System
    </div>

     <p>
      Imagine a multi-tenant SaaS platform with:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       A public SPA + mobile app.
      </li>
      <li>
       API gateway and multiple microservices.
      </li>
      <li>
       Worker queues, cron jobs, and webhooks to third parties.
      </li>
      <li>
       Cloud-hosted databases and object storage.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      In a Zero Trust design:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       Users authenticate via SSO/OIDC (IdP). The resulting tokens are verified by an API
                        gateway or identity-aware proxy at the edge.
      </li>
      <li>
       Every microservice
       <em>
        also
       </em>
       authenticates to other microservices using workload
                        identities (e.g., mTLS with SPIFFE IDs, IAM roles, or service accounts).
      </li>
      <li>
       Network-level policies create
       <strong>
        micro-segments
       </strong>
       : e.g.,
       <code>
        api-gateway
       </code>
       can talk to
       <code>
        billing-service
       </code>
       ,
                        but
       <code>
        user-service
       </code>
       cannot talk directly to
       <code>
        db-billing
       </code>
       .
      </li>
      <li>
       Access decisions leverage context: user role, tenant, device posture, geolocation,
                        anomaly/risk scores.
      </li>
      <li>
       Policies are enforced
       <em>
        every time
       </em>
       :
                        per request, per connection, per background job.

        Traditional perimeter model:
       </strong>
       “hard outside, soft inside”.
                        Once inside the VPN/VPC, many systems implicitly trust you.
      </li>
      <li>
       <strong>
        Zero Trust model:
       </strong>
       no “safe inside”.
                        Every request is treated as if it came from an untrusted network.
      </li>
      <li>
       <strong>
        Micro-segmentation
       </strong>
       builds “internal perimeters” around sensitive
                        components so that lateral movement is hard.
      </li>
      <li>
       <strong>
        Continuous verification
       </strong>
       prevents “once authenticated, forever trusted”
                        scenarios, particularly important for long-lived sessions and privileged users.

     2.1 Analogy: Airport Security vs. Old Office Building
    </div>
    <div class="card-body">
     <p>
      Think of two buildings:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       <strong>
        Old office building (traditional perimeter)
       </strong>
       –
                        Once you get past the receptionist, you can walk into almost any floor, office,
                        or meeting room without showing ID again. If someone tailgates or steals a badge,
                        they can roam freely.
      </li>
      <li>
       <strong>
        Modern airport (Zero Trust-ish)
       </strong>
       –
                        You are continuously checked:
       <ul>
        <li>
         ID + boarding pass at check-in.
        </li>
        <li>
         Security checkpoint scans your luggage and your body.
        </li>
        <li>
         Sometimes additional screening at the gate.
        </li>
        <li>
         Restricted areas (cockpit, staff-only zones) require additional, role-specific
                                credentials.
        </li>
       </ul>
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Micro-segmentation
      </strong>
      is like having many different secured zones:
                    public area, departures hall, gates, staff corridors, cargo, cockpit. You might be allowed
                    into one gate area, but not into the cockpit or cargo zone.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Continuous verification
      </strong>
      is all the ongoing checks:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       Boarding passes re-scanned at the gate.
      </li>
      <li>
       Random bag checks at boarding.
      </li>
      <li>
       Staff badges re-checked when entering secure corridors.

       “airports, not old office buildings”

     <ul>
      <li>
       Airport building → Your cloud/network environment.
      </li>
      <li>
       Boarding pass + ID → User tokens (OIDC ID token, access token, session, device posture).
      </li>
      <li>
       Gate scanners → API gateways, identity-aware proxies, service mesh sidecars.
      </li>

       Restricted zones → Micro-segments (per-service, per-tenant, per-data-domain).

      <li>
       Random checks → Continuous session checks, anomaly detection, just-in-time access.

      If you keep this analogy in mind, Zero Trust design choices become more intuitive:
                    every new “zone” or “role” needs its own access checks and segmentation.

     3.1 Healthy Baseline: A Well-Designed Zero Trust SaaS
    </div>

     <p>
      Consider a B2B multi-tenant SaaS:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       Tenants access via SPA/mobile → API gateway → microservices → DBs/queues.
      </li>
      <li>
       All user and service access is mediated by strong identity and policy.
      </li>
      <li>
       Network is segmented: only required east-west connections are allowed.
      </li>
      <li>
       Every request is authenticated and authorized close to the resource.
      </li>
      <li>
       Risk signals (impossible travel, abnormal API usage, device hygiene) adjust policies.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Security goals:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       <strong>
        Confidentiality
       </strong>
       – Data is only accessible to the right tenant, user,
                        and service, even if part of the network is compromised.
      </li>
      <li>
       <strong>
        Integrity
       </strong>
       – Actions and changes are traceable to authenticated entities,
                        and unauthorized tampering is blocked by policy at each hop.
      </li>
      <li>
       <strong>
        Availability
       </strong>
       – Segmentation limits blast radius of DDoS and abuse
                        (e.g., one noisy tenant or compromised service can’t easily take down the whole platform).
      </li>
      <li>
       <strong>
        Abuse prevention
       </strong>
       – Rate limits, behavioral analytics, and scoped access
                        prevent bulk scraping, mass enumeration, or privilege escalation.

     4.1 The Core Loop of Zero Trust
    </div>
    <div class="card-body">
     <p>
      At its heart, Zero Trust is a repeated decision loop that runs for
      <em>
       every
      </em>
      access attempt:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li>
       <strong>
        Identify
       </strong>
       – Who/what is making the request?
      </li>
      <li>
       <strong>
        Validate
       </strong>
       – Is the identity genuine and current?
      </li>
      <li>
       <strong>
        Evaluate context
       </strong>
       – Where from? Which device? What risk level?
      </li>
      <li>
       <strong>
        Authorize
       </strong>
       – What exactly is allowed, for how long, under what conditions?
      </li>
      <li>
       <strong>
        Enforce
       </strong>
       – Apply the decision at the closest enforcement point.
      </li>
      <li>
       <strong>
        Monitor
       </strong>
       – Log, inspect, and feed behavior to analytics/risk engine.
      </li>
      <li>
       <strong>
        Re-evaluate
       </strong>
       – Adjust decisions as context changes (risk ↑, config change,
                        incident).
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      This loop applies to:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       User → App (e.g., browser to API).

     4.2 Types of Micro-Segmentation

    <div class="card-body">
     <p>
      Micro-segmentation can be implemented at several layers, often in combination:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       <strong>
        Network-based segmentation
       </strong>
       (L3/L4):
       <ul>
        <li>
         Separate VPC subnets or VNets for frontend, backend, data, admin.
        </li>
        <li>
         Security groups/NACLs that allow only specific ports between segments.
        </li>
        <li>
         Host firewalls (e.g.,
         <code>
          iptables
         </code>
         , cloud firewall rules).
        </li>
       </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
       <strong>
        Identity-based segmentation
       </strong>
       (L7, identity-aware):
       <ul>
        <li>
         Policies based on service identities (SPIFFE IDs, IAM roles, service accounts).
        </li>
        <li>
         mTLS between services with mutual certificate verification.
        </li>
        <li>
         Service mesh authorization policies (e.g., allow only
         <code>
          payment-svc
         </code>
         to call
         <code>
          card-vault-svc
         </code>
         ).
        </li>
       </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
       <strong>
        Application-level segmentation
       </strong>
       :
       <ul>
        <li>
         Tenant isolation in application logic (tenant IDs, row-level security).
        </li>
        <li>
         Separate schemas or databases per tenant tier.
        </li>
        <li>
         Dedicated workers/queues per tenant or per risk class.
        </li>
       </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
       <strong>
        Data-level segmentation
       </strong>
       :
       <ul>
        <li>
         Access control at the storage layer (KMS keys per environment/tenant).
        </li>
        <li>
         Bucket/object policies binding identity to specific data prefixes.
        </li>
        <li>
         Attribute-based access control (ABAC) on sensitive fields.

      <strong>
       Key idea:
      </strong>
      Zero Trust is strongest when multiple segmentation layers
                    align: network, identity, application, and data all point towards the same isolation
                    boundaries.

        Session risk scoring

                        Engineers may still mentally treat anything inside the VPC as safe:

                        “because it’s only reachable from the VPN”. In Zero Trust, internal traffic is

                        Introducing Zero Trust without proper token/scopes design can push teams to
                        issue very broad tokens (“admin all the things”) because it’s easier.
                        This technically “fits” the model but defeats the point.

                        Service mesh or discovery tools may auto-register services:
                        if not paired with strict policies, new services may be reachable by default
                        and only locked down later (if at all).

      The “theory” of Zero Trust becomes concrete when you always ask three questions
                    for every interaction in your system:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li>
       <strong>
        Who/what is this?
       </strong>
       (identity)
      </li>
      <li>
       <strong>
        What are they allowed to do?
       </strong>
       (authorization)
      </li>
      <li>
       <strong>
        Should they still be allowed right now?
       </strong>
       (context + continuous verification)
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      If your architecture cannot reliably answer all three for each critical interaction,
                    you have places where Zero Trust is not yet implemented (and likely where attackers will aim).

      Zero Trust collapses when a single SaaS component is allowed to assume implicit trust, so modern playbooks (NIST SP 800-207, CISA Zero Trust Maturity Model) insist on pairing identity, device, and workload posture for every hop.
                     The scenarios below show how microservices that look healthy can still be abused if the verification signals drift or if mesh policies lag deployments.

      When CI runners can reach the service mesh control plane, a leaked token lets attackers register fake workloads and request access to tenant databases.

     <p>
      We study the October 2023 Okta Support System breach, where session tokens from a third-party vendor were used to access customer support consoles.
                     The case demonstrates why Zero Trust must enforce least privilege for every support integration, not only production services.</p>
