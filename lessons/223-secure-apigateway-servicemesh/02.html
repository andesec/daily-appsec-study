      Imagine zero-trust traffic management as an airport where every passenger and aircraft is continuously verified: the API gateway is the security
      checkpoint that inspects people and baggage at the perimeter, while the service mesh is the air-traffic control system that supervises each runway,
      taxiway, and flight path inside the airport. The combination keeps untrusted actors from boarding and ensures approved flights never collide or
      deviate from their assigned corridors, exactly how BeyondCorp policies require identity-aware ingress and Istio enforces encrypted, policy-driven
      service-to-service hops.

      <strong>Analogy → Responsibility Map:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Security checkpoint (API gateway):</strong> validates badge, luggage, and destination context before a traveler steps past the terminal boundary, mirroring BeyondCorp-style continuous verification of user + device posture before allowing any API call into the mesh perimeter.</li>
        <li><strong>Air-traffic control (service mesh):</strong> tracks every authorized aircraft, issues per-runway clearances, and reacts instantly to anomalies, just like Istio sidecars that enforce mutual TLS, rate limits, and circuit-breaking for every intra-mesh hop.</li>
        <li><strong>Shared flight manifest (gateway + mesh telemetry):</strong> lets airport ops reconstruct the entire journey, analogous to propagating trace headers and policy decisions from the gateway to the mesh for deep observability.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <p>
      Use the flow below to narrate the sequence from the first badge swipe at the gateway to how the mesh steers the call safely between services.

    <p>
      Key takeaways:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>The gateway filters intent at the edge, normalizes metadata, and ensures requests meet BeyondCorp-style contextual policies before they touch microservices.</li>
      <li>The mesh keeps enforcing inside the trust boundary—mutual TLS, retries, traffic splitting—akin to how controllers guide every aircraft minute-by-minute.</li>
      <li>Telemetry stitched across both layers is what proves compliance and fuels rapid incident response.</li>
    </ol>
